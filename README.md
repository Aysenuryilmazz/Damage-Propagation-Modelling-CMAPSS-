## Damage Propagation Modelling(CMAPSS)

### Aircraft Engine Run-to-Failure Simulation

- Damage propagation was allowed to continue until a failure criterion was reached. A health index was defined as the minimum of several superimposed operational margins at any given time instant and the failure criterion is reached when health index reaches zero. Output of the model was the time series (cycles) of sensed measurements typically available from aircraft gas turbine engines.
